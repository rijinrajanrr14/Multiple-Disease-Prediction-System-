# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System-
Disease Prediction System<br>

This predictive system is designed to predict multiple diseases, specifically focusing on diabetes and heart disease, using the Random Forest Classifier. The datasets for these diseases were obtained from Kaggle, and the system is deployed using Streamlit, a user-friendly web application framework.

Key Components:

Random Forest Classifier: The predictive model is built using the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning method capable of handling both classification and regression tasks. It has been trained on labeled data from the diabetes and heart disease datasets to accurately predict the presence or absence of these diseases.

Streamlit: The interactive web interface for the predictive system is developed using Streamlit. This library enables developers to create and deploy data-driven web applications with ease, allowing users to access the prediction system through a web browser.

Pickle: The model is saved and loaded using the Pickle library, which facilitates the storage of complex Python objects, such as machine learning models, in a serialized format. This ensures that the trained model can be efficiently stored and retrieved whenever needed.

Streamlit Option Menu: The navigation menu on the web application is enhanced using the "streamlit_option_menu" library, enabling smooth and intuitive user interaction with the multi-disease prediction system.

The datasets used for training and testing the model were sourced from Kaggle and comprise relevant features related to diabetes and heart disease. By leveraging the power of the Random Forest Classifier, the predictive system can provide accurate and reliable disease predictions for users based on input data.

This project serves as a valuable tool for healthcare professionals, researchers, and individuals interested in early disease detection and proactive healthcare management. It can be further extended to incorporate additional disease datasets and refine the model for a broader range of applications.

The code and resources for this multi-disease prediction system can be found in the GitHub repository, allowing other developers and researchers to explore, enhance, and customize the system for specific use cases.
